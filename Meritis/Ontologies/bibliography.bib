	abstract = {The OntoClean methodology was based on a set of formal meta-properties whose semantics were specified in S5 modal logic. One of these metaproperties, Rigidity, has come under more focused scrutiny by the ontology community, and several problems with the formalization have been discussed along with several solutions. In this paper, we attempt to reconcile these results in a larger framework that exposes different kinds of rigidity, as well as two new metaproperties, actuality and permanence, which deal more specifically with the behavior of properties with respect to time and existence.},

	abstract = {Java is a very popular programming language and many study programs in Informatics worldwide include courses particularly designed for its learning. It is considered as the best paradigm for introducing students with object-oriented programming and concepts. Considering Java’s popularity, we initially make an attempt to model this language by using a quite expressing and rich knowledge representation structure, like is ontology. Our aim is to capture the semantics of Java concepts in a way that would render them utilizable by intelligent e-learning applications. Because the construction of an ontology is not an easy task, we follow very specific steps when building the Java ontology. We then take advantage of an already implemented model describing the structure of learning outcomes and combine it with our ontology, with a view to offer a more effective way in organizing the course of Java in the Hellenic Open University.},
